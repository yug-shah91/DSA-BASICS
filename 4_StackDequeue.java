//âœ… Why ArrayDeque is used instead of Stack
//ðŸ”¹ 1. Stack is Old and Slow
//Stack is based on Vector, which is synchronized (thread-safe) â€” this makes it slower.

//But for most DSA/interview problems, you don't need synchronization.
//So Stack is unnecessarily slow for our purpose.
//ðŸ”¹ 2. ArrayDeque is faster
//Internally backed by a resizable array

//No synchronization â†’ much faster
//Constant time for push(), pop(), and peek()

//ðŸ”¹ 3. ArrayDeque supports both ends
//Although we use it as a stack (LIFO), it can also work as a queue (FIFO)
//This makes it super flexible for both Stack and Queue DSA problems
