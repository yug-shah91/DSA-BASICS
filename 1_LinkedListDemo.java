     static means:
ðŸ‘‰ "This thing belongs to the class, not to any object."

Imagine a college class:
static = college rules (shared by all students)
non-static = each student's name, ID (unique to each)


     But WHY do we want it static?
Because the Node is just a box holding:
data
next
It doesnâ€™t need to know anything about the outer LinkedList.
So why force it to depend on the outer class?
